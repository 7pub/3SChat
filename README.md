## ``Matchmaking function``

Sometimes old IP's become different people's server. For example a
company uses a Digitalocean VPS and after one year they switched to amazon
so they remove their VPS instance. The IP is then released and then used by
some dude's server for a hobby project. To verify if we got a hit, we need
to inspect the HTML and compare it from the WAF and the direct IP and Calculate
a match percentage. This is exactly what we are going to do here.
This script is called later on in the script.


### ``IP Validation``

We need to check if the IP we find is not just the current IP and not
a public WAF service.


### ``Subdomain Gathering``

## Subdomains can point to origin IP's behind the firewall (WAF)
